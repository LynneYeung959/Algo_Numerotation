# Algo_Numerotation

Project consists in determining all the minimal numberings of a given undirected and connected graph G = <V,E>. A numbering of the vertices of G is a bijection η: V —> {1, …., n} such that η(v) indicates the number of the vertex v
of G. The rank of the numbering η is the number, denoted rη(G), such that rη(G) = max { |η(u) - η(v)| : (u, v) ∈ E }
